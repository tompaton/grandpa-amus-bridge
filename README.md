I was able to export a .step file, import that into FreeCAD and generate a drawing.

## Scale model

### Materials

* 8mm x 1200mm Tasmanian oak round dowel (2 pieces)
* 6mm x 6mm x 1200mm Tasmanian oak square dowel (2 pieces)
* 3mm x 100mm x 1000mm balsa sheet (1 piece)

There wasn't much waste, probably about 20mm left from each of the
round and square dowels.  Only 1/3 of the balsa sheet was needed.

### Tools

* Craft knife
* Mini-hacksaw
* Sandpaper

### Construction

Construction was done by eye, cutting with the craft knife when it
would have been more sensible to make a jig to drill mortises.

Rails were created by splitting the square dowel.

### Finished model

The final model would hold together without glue, but it's a bit
fragile that way and I've spent enough time assembling it, so I glued
it with PVA craft glue.

It was then finished with a few coats of shellac.
